    Yesterday:
        Finished Frontend for the most part
            Add a search for the names in the currect list that's already been fetched
            Add a button on each expert card that lets you edit the notes and other fields of that expert
            Search by company instead of select menu
            rename company names for better searching
        Fixed some bugs on the script
        Populated the database
    Today:
        Figure out ways to automate the script more
        Edit notes and expert fields through frontend

frontend:
    pagination

backend:
    to check if expert is already in list
database:
